== Introduction

Intrig Xenon provides flexible, powerful and easy to use C++ API for decoding protocol
messages.

Originally developed for 3G and 4G programmers and test engineers to decode their
complex messages, the xenon decoder has evolved into a general purpose open source
tool with an ever expanding protocol support base.

And, using XDDL, you can support your own proprietary message formats.

See xenon in action for yourself using the Intrig online decoder:
http://intrig.com/x82da86[intrig.com].

=== Quick Start

==== Building on Mac and Linux

From a terminal, issue the following commands:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/intrig/xenon.git
    cd xenon
    make
    make test
    sudo make install

==== Building on Windows

Windows requires the following steps:

1. Install https://desktop.github.com[Github Desktop]
2. Clone the xenon repo as above.
3. Install https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html[meson]

Follow the instructions in the above link to have meson generate the Visual
Studio build files.

=== Dependencies

* https://mesonbuild.com[meson]
* C++17 or later compiler
* Github desktop (for Windows only)

== Using Xenon

Link with the libxenon.so library, found in `/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxenon.so`
on Ubuntu.

The header files are found in `/usr/local/include/xenon`.

The XDDL data files are found in `/usr/local/share/xddl`.

See the `xenon/examples` directory for some common uses of the decoder.

If you want to parse your own custom protocols, then the
https://github.com/intrig/xenon/blob/master/docs/xddl.adoc[XDDL Reference] is a complete
reference containing useful examples.

Also, the tools directory contains useful examples, such as `idm` and `xv`.  These
two programs are installed into `/usr/local/bin`.

=== Converting 3GPP asn.1 to XDDL

`asnx` converts asn.1 PER files to xddl.  It handles a subset of the asn.1 spec.
If there any problems please submit an issue.

For 3GPP specs, e.g. 36.331:

1. Download the latest pdf spec.
2. Save it to text file, e.g. 36.331.txt.
   
Ubuntu the pdftotext command can be used, for example:

```
pdftotext -nopgbrk -layout ts_136331v150700p.pdf 36.331.txt
```

3. Run: asn-strip -m 36.331.txt > 36.331.asn

4. Run: asnx -o TS-36.331.xddl -t 36.331.asn

Edit 36.331.asn by hand.  Some of the lines may have been broken at '-'
characters.  Fix the errors by hand and run the above step repeatedly until you fixed the errors.

6. Add resulting xddl file to git.

Enjoy!
